These rules apply to third-party servers ("instances") that federate with the Project Mesa network or use the Project Mesa protocol.

## 1. Operator Responsibility
You are solely responsible for your instance, including moderation, technical stability, and legal compliance in your jurisdiction.

## 2. Federation Eligibility
Instances may be blocked or defederated from the Project Mesa network for:
- Spamming or abusive behavior;
- Hosting illegal content;
- Repeated failures to moderate harmful behavior.

We reserve the right to limit or remove federation with any instance at our discretion to preserve network integrity.

## 3. Data Handling and Security
Operators must respect the encryption and metadata boundaries of the protocol. End-to-end encryption must not be altered or bypassed. Exposed metadata must be handled responsibly.

## 4. Recommended Practices
- Provide a public contact method for abuse or support;
- Publish a clear moderation policy;
- Respect opt-outs, defederation lists, and block requests from other servers.

## 5. Use of Brand and Software
You may use the client/server software under its open-source license, but must not imply official endorsement or affiliation without written permission.

## 6. Contact
For coordination, defederation notices, or abuse reports related to federation with our infrastructure: [admin@projectmesa.qzz.io]
