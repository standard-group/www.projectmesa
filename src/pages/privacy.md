Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy describes the types of data we collect, how it is used, and your rights regarding your personal information.

## 1. Data We Collect
When using the official Project Mesa server or client, we may process:
- IP addresses and connection metadata;
- Timestamps and protocol headers;
- No message contents (due to end-to-end encryption).

## 2. End-to-End Encryption
Messages are encrypted client-side. Neither we nor any federated servers can access the plaintext contents of your communications.

## 3. Use of Data
We use limited metadata to:
- Operate and maintain service infrastructure;
- Prevent abuse or malicious behavior;
- Ensure performance and security.

We **do not sell or share personal data** with third parties for marketing purposes.

## 4. Infrastructure & Hosting
We use **Cloudflare** for DDoS protection, HTTPS termination, and edge caching of our infrastructure. As part of this, Cloudflare may temporarily process your IP address and request metadata to ensure network security and availability.

Our web services and federation endpoints are hosted behind Cloudflare.

## 5. Analytics
We use **Cloudflare Insights** to gather basic, privacy-respecting usage statistics about our website. This includes:
- Page views and aggregated visit data;
- Browser type and device category;
- Approximate location (region-level only).

Cloudflare Insights is GDPR-compliant and does not use cookies or track you across other websites.

## 6. Self-Hosted Servers
Federated servers are independently operated. If you connect to a third-party server, this policy does not apply to their data practices. Server operators are responsible for their own privacy disclosures.

## 7. Data Retention
Connection logs are stored temporarily for abuse prevention and debugging. We retain data only as long as necessary for operational purposes.

## 8. Your Rights
You may contact us to:
- Request deletion of metadata associated with your account;
- Ask questions about how your data is handled.

## 9. GDPR and CCPA Compliance

We respect the privacy rights of all users, including those under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**.

If you are a resident of the **EU/EEA** or **California**, you have the right to:
- Access the personal data we process about you;
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
- Request information about how your data is used;
- Object to or restrict certain types of processing;
- Request portability of your data (EU/EEA only).

We do **not sell personal data**. We also do not offer financial incentives for data collection.

To exercise your rights, please contact us at [volumetech@getgoogleoff.me](mailto:volumetech@getgoogleoff.me). We will respond within the timeframes required by law.

## 10. Policy Updates
We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Material changes will be posted with a revised effective date.
